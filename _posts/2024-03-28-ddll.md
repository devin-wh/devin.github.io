## auto range manger
DDLL means "double direction linked list".
In some times, we expect to mange range feature, which including start address、stop address and size properties.
But，due to the range may be overlaped, but we don't want to make them split, there should be some methods to merge them like water flowing into together.
```
1. Use "DDLL" to manger range area. each node means one range
2. The range of differen nodes shouln't be overlaped
3. If you push one new node into "DDLL", if it has no overlay with any other nodes.Insert it from small to big according to range start address.
4. If you push one new node into "DDLL", but there has overlay with other nodes.
   First, place the new node into "DDLL" from small to big.
   Second, ahead and back search for the head and tail node of the overlay range.
   Finally, repleace the overlap nodes with one new merged node.
```

提示：异或操作是交换的 (𝑎 ⊕ 𝑏 = 𝑏 ⊕ 𝑎)，结合的 ((𝑎 ⊕ 𝑏) ⊕ 𝑐 = 𝑎 ⊕ (𝑏 ⊕
𝑐))，是它自己的逆操作 (𝑎 ⊕ 𝑎 = 0)，并且有一个单位元(𝑎 ⊕ 0 = 𝑎)。
