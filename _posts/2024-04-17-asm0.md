## assembly introduce
> Assembly language is a low-level programming language that is closely related to machine code instructions. It provides a symbolic representation of the instructions understood by a particular CPU architecture. Unlike high-level programming languages like C or Python, assembly language directly corresponds to the instructions executed by the CPU.

and Assembly language is typically used to write programs that directly manipulate computer hardware. Therefore, different compilers may have slight differences when generating assembly language, depending on factors such as compiler implementation, optimization strategies, and target architecture.

However, the basic concepts and syntax of assembly language are usually similar because they represent a direct way of manipulating computer hardware. For example, common concepts such as instructions, registers, and memory access are typically the same or similar across different compilers.

Additionally, assembly language may vary depending on the target architecture. For instance, assembly language for x86 architecture and ARM architecture may have some differences due to their distinct instruction sets and register sets.

Therefore, while assembly language may have some differences across different compilers, its fundamental syntax and concepts are generally similar.

## assembly architecture
Here's a brief introduction to assembly language along with a simple assembly code snippet:
{: .prompt-danger }

```assembly
section .data
    msg db 'Hello, world!', 0

section .text
    global _start

_start:
    ; write syscall
    mov eax, 4         ; syscall number for sys_write
    mov ebx, 1         ; file descriptor 1 (stdout)
    mov ecx, msg       ; address of the message to print
    mov edx, 13        ; length of the message
    int 0x80           ; invoke the kernel

    ; exit syscall
    mov eax, 1         ; syscall number for sys_exit
    xor ebx, ebx       ; exit status 0
    int 0x80           ; invoke the kernel
```

In this assembly code, we have two sections: `.data` and `.text`. The `.data` section is used for declaring data, and the `.text` section contains the actual executable code.

In the `.data` section, we declare a message 'Hello, world!' and terminate it with a null byte (0). In the `.text` section, we define a global label `_start`, which is the entry point of the program.

The code inside `_start` performs two system calls using the `int 0x80` instruction:
1. The first syscall (`sys_write`) prints the message stored in `msg` to the standard output.
2. The second syscall (`sys_exit`) terminates the program with an exit status of 0.

Assembly language provides a way to interact directly with the hardware and control the low-level details of program execution, making it essential for tasks like operating system development, embedded systems programming, and performance-critical applications. However, it is less portable and more complex compared to high-level languages.
