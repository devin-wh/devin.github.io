### SSH Port Forwarding

SSH port forwarding is a method of tunneling network traffic through a secure SSH connection. There are two main types of SSH port forwarding: local port forwarding and remote port forwarding.

### Local Port Forwarding

Local port forwarding redirects traffic from a local port through the SSH server to a destination port on another server. It is often used to access a service that is not directly accessible from the local machine.

#### Syntax

```sh
ssh -L [local_port]:[destination_host]:[destination_port] [ssh_server]
```

#### Example

Suppose you want to forward local port 8080 to port 80 on `example.com` via `ssh-server.com`:

```sh
ssh -L 8080:example.com:80 user@ssh-server.com
```

Explanation:
- `-L` specifies local port forwarding.
- `8080` is the local port on your machine.
- `example.com` is the destination host.
- `80` is the port on the destination host.
- `user@ssh-server.com` is the SSH server and user you are connecting through.

After running this command, you can access `http://localhost:8080` on your local machine, and the traffic will be securely forwarded to `example.com:80`.

### Remote Port Forwarding

Remote port forwarding redirects traffic from a port on the SSH server to a port on the local machine or another server. It is useful for exposing a local service to the outside world.

#### Syntax

```sh
ssh -R [remote_port]:[destination_host]:[destination_port] [ssh_server]
```

#### Example

Suppose you want to forward port 9090 on `ssh-server.com` to port 8080 on your local machine:

```sh
ssh -R 9090:localhost:8080 user@ssh-server.com
```

Explanation:
- `-R` specifies remote port forwarding.
- `9090` is the port on the SSH server.
- `localhost` refers to the local machine (relative to `ssh-server.com`).
- `8080` is the port on your local machine.
- `user@ssh-server.com` is the SSH server and user you are connecting through.

After running this command, you can access `http://ssh-server.com:9090` on the SSH server, and the traffic will be securely forwarded to `localhost:8080` on your local machine.

### Use Cases

1. **Local Port Forwarding**:
   - Accessing internal company resources (e.g., databases, servers) without a VPN.
   - Securely accessing internal services.

2. **Remote Port Forwarding**:
   - Exposing local services to the external network.
   - Remotely accessing development applications.

### Considerations

1. Ensure you have the necessary permissions to set up port forwarding on the SSH server.
2. Ensure that firewalls allow the relevant port traffic.
3. When used in production, ensure security by restricting access to forwarded ports to authorized users only.

### Summary

SSH port forwarding is a powerful tool for securely redirecting traffic between different networks. Using the `ssh` command, you can easily set up both local and remote port forwarding to meet various needs. Below are the command examples for both types of port forwarding:

**Local Port Forwarding**:
```sh
ssh -L 8080:example.com:80 user@ssh-server.com
```

**Remote Port Forwarding**:
```sh
ssh -R 9090:localhost:8080 user@ssh-server.com
```

These commands help you securely manage and access services across different network boundaries.
